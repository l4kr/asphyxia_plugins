Welcome to the enhanced version of the **Asphyxia CORE Community Plugins**. This repository contains a collection of plugins for rhythm games (SDVX, IIDX) with significant improvements in functionality, synchronization, and user experience.

## New Features

### Tachi Sync Scores
Synchronize your scores seamlessly with **Tachi**.
- Automatic or manual score reporting.
- Support for detailed play data.
- Easy configuration via the WebUI.

### Last.fm Scrobbling
Scrobble songs you play directly to your **Last.fm** profile.
- Automatic scrobbling on score save, per-profile toggle via the WebUI.
- IIDX scrobbles with real artist/title data; SDVX uses song title with "SOUND VOLTEX" as artist.
- Configure `lastfm_api_key` and `lastfm_api_secret` in `config.ini`.

### Score Migration
Easily move your data between game versions.
- **Eg to Nabla**: Specialized handlers to migrate your SDVX profiles
- Integrated database update checks to keep your data safe.

### RyuNET Compatibility
This version of the plugins is fully optimized and compatible with [RyuNET-core](https://github.com/Ryu7w7/RyuNET-core), ensuring a stable and high-performance environment for your private server.
